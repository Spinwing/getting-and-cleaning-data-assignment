## Synopsis
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable 
computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop 
the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data represent data 
collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 
A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

The script run_analysis.R performs the following operations:

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each 
measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with 
the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
